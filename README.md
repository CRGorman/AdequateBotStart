Are you tired of building a starter base to research bots only to tear it down while waiting too long for bots to recharge? Mega Bot Start lets you start with construction bots in a Vanilla+ way. You'll start with:

* Power armor Mk.2
* 50-500 construction robots
* 4 Personal roboport Mk.2
* 4 Portable fusion reactors
* 2 Battery Mk.2
* 4 Energy Shield Mk.2

You can choose to have faster worker speed unlocked as well.

Now compatible with mods including Bob's Warfare/Logistics/Personal Equipment and Krastorio 2. Enabling those mods will give different armors and a different equipment grid.

No existing items are changed. No new items are added.

Originally forked from [Peppe Bot Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Peppe/PeppeBotStart), then again from [OneBit](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/onebit/AdequateBotStart). Changed from modular armor to Power armor Mk.2 and replaced solar panels with fusion reactors.
