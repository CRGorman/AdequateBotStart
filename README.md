Adequate Bot Start lets you start with construction bots in the most vanilla way possible. You'll start with:

* Modular armor
* 20 construction robots
* 2 personal roboports
* 15 portable solar panels
* A battery

No technology is unlocked. No existing items are changed. No new items are added.

Forked from [Peppe Bot Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Peppe/PeppeBotStart). The main difference is that the special starter modular armor was removed.
