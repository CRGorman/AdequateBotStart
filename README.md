Are you tired of building a starter base to research bots and blueprints only to tear it down? Adequate Bot Start lets you start with construction bots in a Vanilla+ way. You'll start with:

* Modular armor
* 20 construction robots
* 2 personal roboports
* 15 portable solar panels
* A battery

No technology is unlocked. No existing items are changed. No new items are added.

Forked from [Peppe Bot Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Peppe/PeppeBotStart). The special starter modular armor was removed, along with the blueprints which aren't needed in 0.15.
